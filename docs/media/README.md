# BeetPx / examples / simple

A very simple example of a BeetPx app.

For simplicity, everything the whole code is within a single file.

Commands to run this example locally, in your web browser:

```
npm install
npm start
```

When started:

- You will see BeetPx logo circling around a point. Use your keyboard / WSAD or gamepad D-Pad / sticks to move it around the canvas.
- You will also hear a music played in a loop.
- If you press the Enter or a menu button on your gamepad, the app will restart.
- The app should be served in a "watch" mode, meaning if make any changes to [./src/beetpx.ts](src/beetpx.ts), your browser will automatically reload the app to reflect most recent changes.
