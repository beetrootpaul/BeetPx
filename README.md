## Getting Started

Add it to your project with:

```shell
npm install --save-dev --save-exact @beetpx/beetpx
```

It might make sense in a future to drop `--save-exact` flag, but for now better
be safe than sorry ‚Äì in this early phase of development the engine constantly
evolves and quite often breaking changes are introduced.

‚ÑπÔ∏è üëâ There is a simple single-file example in
[examples/simple/src/main.ts](https://github.com/beetrootpaul/beetpx/blob/main/examples/simple/src/main.ts) . Run it as
described in its README.

Also, you might want to take a look at how following projects are using BeetPx:

| game                   | GitHub repository                                                                                   | screenshot                                                       |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hat Escape**         | [beetrootpaul/hat-escape](https://github.com/beetrootpaul/hat-escape)                               | <img src="misc/game-example-hat-escape.png" width="192">         |
| **Dart-07**            | [beetrootpaul/dart-07-beetpx](https://github.com/beetrootpaul/dart-07-beetpx)                       | <img src="misc/game-example-dart-07.gif" width="192">            |
| **Towers of Survival** | [beetrootpaul/towers-of-survival-beetpx](https://github.com/beetrootpaul/towers-of-survival-beetpx) | <img src="misc/game-example-towers-of-survival.png" width="192"> |
| **Avoid Your Past**    | [beetrootpaul/avoid-your-past-beetpx](https://github.com/beetrootpaul/avoid-your-past-beetpx)       | <img src="misc/game-example-avoid-your-past.png" width="192">    |

## Game Controls

The BeetPx engine supports a following sets of game buttons and their mappings
from physical devices:

| game button     | keyboard               | DualSense controller | Xbox controller |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- | --------------- |
| **A**           | `C` / `J`              | cross / triangle     | `A` / `Y`       |
| **B**           | `X` / `K`              | circle / square      | `B` / `X`       |
| **menu**        | `P` / `return` / `esc` | menu                 | menu            |
| **directions**  | arrows / `WSAD`        | D-pad / sticks       | D-pad / sticks  |
| **mute/unmute** | `M`                    |                      |                 |
| **full screen** | `F`                    |                      |                 |

Other game controllers might works as well. For example, this engine has an
implemented support for **8BitDo Lite 2**.

There are also **touch controls** in form of GUI buttons resembling a physical
ones. You can see and use them on touch devices like e.g. an iPhone.

Dev controls meant to be used by the game developer themselves and gated behind
related engine config fields:

- **toggle debug**:
  - on keyboard: `;`
- **toggle frame-by-frame**:
  - on keyboard: `,`
- **jump to the next frame** (only while in frame-by-frame mode):
  - on keyboard: `.`

To check if your controls work as expected, go to `examples/input-tester`, then
run `npm install`, then `npm start` and test your controllers in an
automatically opened browser tab.

### API

You can find docs at https://beetpx.dev .

‚ö†Ô∏è Please be aware the docs are very raw so far. There are mostly just a list of
exposed types and classes and constants, and nothing more. This is something to
be improved before 1.0 release.

‚ÑπÔ∏è For a quick start you can start by typing either `BeetPx.` and checking what
your IDE suggests. The BeetPx follows a convention of having all functions and
constants exposed through `BeetPx.`, `BeetPx.draw.`, and `BeetPx.helpers.`.
Their shorthands are `$`, `$d`, and `$u`.

## Development Setup

This projects is developed on
[Node.js 18](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/index.html).

You might find it helpful to use
[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) in order to make
sure you use the same Node.js version as which is specified in `.nvmrc` file.

There is no CI configured for this project. For now, it is developed by me only,
and all tests as well as the compilation happen in a pre-commit hook.

## The Origin

My idea for BeetPx came from a good time I had working on mini games in
[PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php). That fantasy consoles hit a
very sweet spot for me: in PICO-8 you are creating low resolution pixel art
games, to do so you use a globally available simple API, and all your creations
can easily run in a desktop browser or a mobile one.

There are though some areas I would like differently:

- I prefer to use a typed language and a one which follows a standard. In PICO-8
  I had to use a custom version of Lua, which meant difficulties in finding a
  decent extension for an IDE of my choice.
- PICO-8 has a token limit, which generally means a limit on how much code you
  are allowed to write and an incentive to use a short language constructs as
  possible rather than optimizing for a code maintenance. I understand this is a
  heated topic in PICO-8 community and I also see advantages of the limited
  approach ‚Äì e.g. it helps to keep games low scoped and, in result finish them!
  Also, it is sometimes a real fun to come with clever solutions for hunting
  tokens down üòÑ. But when it comes to my personal preferences, I more often was
  frustrated by the token limit rather then enjoying it.
- There is a minor issues with a browser build of PICO-8 games, where the long
  press of a in-game button on iOS Safari results with a system text selection
  to appear and prevents from playing a game smoothly. Of course, this is
  something I could work around by adjusting an HTML template exported from
  PICO-8. But since I decided to create my own engine, I am able to take care of
  browser iOS experience and do it the way I like.
- Last but not least: I just wanted to have something created for public,
  [available on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@beetpx/beetpx), something I
  feel I am capable to do and can be proud of later ‚ò∫Ô∏è

That being said, I am very grateful that PICO-8 exists and there is a big
community around it. If not for PICO-8, BeetPx would never be created üíõ

### Fonts

While you are able (and encouraged) to define your own font (as an
implementation of `BpxFont` interface), there are 3 fonts ready to use in BeetPx
out of the box:

- `$font_pico8` (the default one)
- `$font_saint11Minimal4`
- `$font_saint11Minimal5`

The first one is a font from PICO-8 fantasy console, available under a CC-0
license (public domain, free to use). For more info see:
https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php?page=faq

Two other fonts are created by [Saint11](https://saint11.org/about/) and
available on https://saint11.org/blog/fonts/ under a CC-0 license (public
domain, free to use).

### Color Palettes

There is a PICO-8 color palette ready to use, exported as `$rgb_p8`. That
palette is created by zep and available under a CC-0 license (public domain,
free to use). For more info see: https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php?page=faq

## Random Notes

- Gamepad input seems to be laggy (at least on Firefox), unsuitable for fast
  paced games.
- It's good to avoid `.forEach`, `.reduce` and similar functions and use classic
  `for` loops instead. The former tend to have significantly worse performance
  due to an extra function call in each iteration.
