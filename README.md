> A mini framework for low-res browser games, written in TypeScript.

## Getting Started

Add it to your project with: 

```sh
npm install --save-dev --save-exact @beetpx/beetpx
```

It might make sense in a future to drop `--save-exact` flag, but for now better be safe than sorry â€“ in this early phase of development the framework constantly evolves and quite often breaking changes are introduced.

There is a simple example in [./examples/simple/](examples/simple/README.md) . Run it as described in [its README](examples/simple/README.md).
